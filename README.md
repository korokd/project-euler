Solving [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) with FP and TDD


## Running
### Tests
* You will need to have `elm` and `elm-test` installed globally on your machine
    * `elm` will also work via [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/#/)

Just run `elm-test` at the root of the project. If all tests are passing, the solutions to all problems should be right, since there should be a test case against its [solution](https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions/blob/master/Solutions.md)

You can also run `elm reactor`, and navigate to `src/Main.elm`, where you should see a list of the solutions to each problem.


* Reminder that this is a WIP and when you see it there will probably be only a few problems solved. I'm doing this mostly to have an experience with TDD - even if it's not something amazing - and to do things Functional, without any way to not do so.
